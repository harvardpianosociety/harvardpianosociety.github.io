Download the cs50-project zip file from Gradescope and access either by copy and pasting all the files
into your own IDE or download the zip file and upload it to the IDE and unzip the files. Change directory to the folder and
type http-server and access the website. Go to index.html to access the mainpage.

The website itself is pretty intuitive to use. From the mainpage, you can access a variety of sub-pages.
The top bar has a logo on the top left which can direct the user back to the index page if they wish from any subpage.
The right side of the top bar has the other five subpages cataloged, which are accessible from any of the other subpages on the website.
All the pages can be used using a basic scroll up and down.

In the about page, the user can find a brief description of the Harvard College Piano Society, a picture of Yuja Wang at an event,
current members list from TheHub, and useful links. Clicking any of the five useful links will open up a new tab, instead of
replacing the current website.

In the events page, the user will see a default "Coming Soon" page. I did not have enough time to fill it in, and because I
am trying to revive this club, there are also no events to advertise as of right now. If I had more time, I would have created
a calendar-like feature where users can see when club-sponsored events are and when member-pubbed events (solo recitals) are.

In the news page, the user will find advertising materials from past events organized by the piano society. Most of these posters
are from 2013-2016. The user can find news coverage (mostly The Crimson) of HCPS events at the bottom of the page. These
links will also open up new tabs instead of replacing the already-open HCPS website tab.

In the media page, the user will find videos from past recitals in various venues as well as a button that will redirect
the user to the HCPS YouTube channel. Below the videos section, the user can find images from past events.

In the contact page, the user can find some inviting images and a friendly message encouraging the user to contact HCPS
using the written email.
