Design:

I took inspiration of the index page look from the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra website (https://www.harvardradcliffeorchestra.org/)
and the navigation bar from Bach Society Orchestra website (http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~bachsoc/index).
I did not copy and paste any source code from these websites, but rather tried to understand what was going on under the hood using inspect.

Getting the aesthetic to my liking took the most time.
I chose a base background horizontal gradation of black to a darkish gold because I wanted the website to feel serious
and official. The image of Sanders Theater adds a luminous glow. The Harvard Piano Society text moves as the browser
size changes for some visual sugar. I also chose Times New Roman font with a specific spacing and weight to
add website tone consistency but also make it easily legible.

It also took me much effort to figure out how to set a minimum browser size --
I didn't want the wrappers or texts to be too out of proportion in extreme scenarios, so I
toyed around with the @media features until I decided on a max-width of 920px. It felt just right.

I very deliberately chose these five specific subpage categories: about, events, news, media, and contact.
The about page is meant to introduce the club concisely and simply without much fuss. The events page would advertise
upcoming club and member events. Due to the mission of the club not only organizing recitals but also promoting student pianists,
it's essential that the website promote both member projects as well as initiatives taken by the entire club. The news page
holds past highlights to make the club seem "hip" haha -- a track record of events also adds credibility to a revival.
The media page further adds to the "hip" factor and adds more color and substance to what the club does.
And any club website needs to share some contact info or have a way for users to contact the club.

In each subpage, the headings are marked with a simple asterix (* Heading *) tag.
All the text and images are wrapped with dark yellow so the white text pops out more easily.

The about page has the most text because it serves a lot of functions: containing the mission statement, spotlightigh a big event,
listing out current members, and having useful links. Other websites I browsed around had all the information on separate pages, which
I found somewhat tedious. I think the simplicity of having everything on website streamlines the viewers' eyes. The about page
wrapper and images decrease in width as you scroll down, pointing the user downward to nudge them to reading the entire page.

----
Some little tidbits:
I explored varying the layout of pictures through the subpages, so the news page has some images taking up two columns while each column
takes up roughly the same "row" space.

In the media page, the button text changes from white to gray when the cursor is on the button
to nudge users to clicking on it and checking out the HCPS YouTube channel. This is not the case for other links -- the cursor itself
changes for them, not the color of the text because the website shouldn't necessarily encourage users to actively go off the website
unless they deliberately intend to. The YouTube link is different -- it showcases more HCPS performances. The useful links and the news links under
the about and news page respectively won't be as useful as the YouTube channel in showcasing what HCPS does.

I obtained the images from the HCPS facebook and plain google searches. The Sanders Theater image was slightly altered
using a filter website in case bots flag it for whatever reason.
